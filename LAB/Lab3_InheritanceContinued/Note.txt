Inheritance continued!!!

Here in parent class define 
"private field" and "private methods"
and then try to access them in the child class using Set and Get command!!!
Privatr => inherited but not accessible

While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.
